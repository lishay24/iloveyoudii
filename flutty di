    const letterText = `🌸 For My Flutty Di 🌸

We started off simple, nothing special, nothing deep,
Barely a hi, barely a bond, just names we chose to keep
No moment marked the beginning, no spark, no reason why,
Yet somehow life stitched our stories, quietly, you and I ✨

I heard about you from Ninja, his UC tales and your grace,
38 and an amazing mom, that’s all I knew of your face 👩‍👧
On DC you seemed older, calmer, while I was loud and wild,
You stood there strong and silent, and I reacted like a child 😅

One day things got messy, and I exploded like I do 💥
But you stopped them with one sentence, short, simple, firm and true
I hated that calmness then, I didn’t understand your way,
But now I see your silence said what anger could never say 🌙

Slowly we started talking, and somehow I found in you,
A peace I had never tasted, a comfort honest and true 💗
We ranted, joked, bashed Ninja, okay mostly me and you,
And every secret you shared felt like déjà vu 🤝

So many shared traumas, so many mirrored scars,
Like fate made us emotional twins under the same tired stars 🌌
We’re stupid at saving ourselves, but wise when others call,
And maybe you’re the smartest, but I learned from you after all 💫

But even twins have clashes, and sometimes we broke apart,
Sometimes silence grew like winter, and froze a piece of my heart ❄️
I thought I lost you completely when I returned from Hajj again,
Thought no one cared I was missing, thought I was easy to replace 💔

I doubted your affection, I doubted what you gave,
Not knowing my own insecurities were causing this little wave 🌊
And di, for that, I’m sorry, for every hurtful word I let slip,
For every dark assumption, every fear I let equip 😔

You deserved a softer friend, one who didn’t make you ache,
Yet you stayed, you held your patience, you never called me fake 🤍
Thank you for every whisper that healed a heavy night,
For every time your silence taught me how not to fight 🌿

Thank you for being my diary, my home in a noisy crowd,
For hearing my endless rants, the quiet ones and the loud 🌼
Thank you for trusting your secrets with someone broken like me,
I swear I’ll guard them always, as safely as can be 🔐

I’m sorry for the moments when I made our bond feel small,
Sorry for the times you stayed calm while I created the fall 😣
But di, through all my chaos, one thing remains true,
My heart grew softer, lighter, kinder, all because of you 💞

If time or distance separate us, if DC ever fades away,
I’ll still remember you dii, in every tomorrow, every day 🌙✨
My comfort, my solace, my jaan, my safe place to cry,
My sister not by birth, but by destiny’s quiet tie 👭💖

Thank you for everything,
I’m sorry for everything,
I love you, my Flutty di 💗`;
